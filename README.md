# Movie Recommendation
Movie recommendation systems are becoming increasingly popular in today's society. These systems help users discover new movies that they might like based on their viewing history and preferences. In this project, we have developed a movie recommendation system using machine learning models and Python.

We first collected a large dataset of movies and their associated features, such as genre, cast, and plot summary. We then used natural language processing techniques to extract features from the plot summaries. Next, we built several machine learning models, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models. These models were trained on the dataset to predict which movies a user would like based on their viewing history and preferences.

We evaluated the performance of the models using a variety of metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Our results show that the hybrid model outperformed the other models, achieving an accuracy of over 90%. We also created a web application that allows users to enter their movie preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations based on the trained models.

Overall, our movie recommendation system provides a valuable tool for movie lovers to discover new movies that they are likely to enjoy. Our use of machine learning models and Python demonstrates the potential for these technologies to improve the quality of personalized recommendations in a variety of domains.
